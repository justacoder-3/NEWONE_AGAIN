# Simple chat feature
->Install socket.io and express before running (npm install express socket.io)

-> Enter sender's name and reciever's name and then chat.

-> If the messages need to be seen from the reciever's side then open a new tab, enter the sender's name as the previous tab's reciever and then reciever's name as previous tab's sender. Then you can see those messages. 

-> Note that previous messages wont be shown becoz no implementation of MongoDB nor any code for storing messages temporarily in server.js is added.

// Used -
-> Express
-> socket io
-> html

// Need to be added later - 
-> MongoDB 
-> React
-> Tailwind
-> Routing (Router-dom)
